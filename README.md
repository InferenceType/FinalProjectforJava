My final project for my Algorithm Design Class. Using the UserInfo class to keep track of 
user input and calculate the percentage of which which option was clicked the most. This 
was a fun project that professor Dr.Canada had guided us in and it help lay the foundationm 
for Object Oriented Programming and the Java language.
